📝 Fake Review Detection System
This project is a simple but effective command-line tool that uses a machine learning model to classify product reviews as either genuine or deceptive. It's built as a proof-of-concept for a larger system that could be used to combat fake reviews.

🚀 How It Works
The system uses a Naive Bayes classifier, a machine learning algorithm well-suited for text classification.

Data Loading: It reads a dataset of labeled reviews (both genuine and fake) from a CSV file.

Feature Extraction: The text of each review is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which helps the model understand the importance of different words.

Model Training: The model is trained on a portion of the dataset to learn the patterns that differentiate genuine reviews from fake ones.

Prediction: Once trained, the model can take a new, unseen review and predict whether it is likely to be deceptive.

🛠️ Setup
Create a folder for the project (e.g., fake-review).

Download the dataset named deceptive_reviews.csv and place it inside the fake-review folder.

Save the Python script as fake_review_detector.py in the same folder.

Install the required libraries by running this command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install pandas scikit-learn
💻 Usage
Navigate to the fake-review directory in your terminal.

Run the script using the following command:

Bash

python fake_review_detector.py
The script will print the model's accuracy and then prompt you to enter a review for prediction.# fake-review-prediction-challenge
